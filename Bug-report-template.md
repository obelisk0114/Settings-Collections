# The bug report template

## Description

Read all the sentences, wordings and steps that are used in the bug report. See if any sentence is creating ambiguity that can lead to misinterpretation. Misleading words or sentences should be avoided in order to have a clear bug report.

## Related links or documents

spec, discussion…

## Environment

Device, OS, Testing App and Version, Screen size

Connection type (if relevant)
Account used (if relevant): This matters if testers are given test accounts by the client. it's best to then include email + password in the issue report. When the developers get the bug they understand which account was used to discover the issue.

## Steps to reproduce

Number your steps from beginning to end, with as much detail as possible, so we can easily follow through by repeating the same process. If many products have the same issues, you **MUST** tell us **exact product names** in reproduce steps, and you can mention that product B/C… have the same issues without reproduce steps. 

Example description for steps to reproduce a bug:
1. Go to ExampleURL.com
2. Click button A
3. Select option B
4. Type "123"
5. Click Enter

In step 2, button B and C have the same issues with the same reproduce steps. (If button B and C have the same issues, you **MUST provide** this sentences.)
